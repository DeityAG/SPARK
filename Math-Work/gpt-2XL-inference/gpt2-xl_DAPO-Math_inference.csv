If the probability that the coin doesn't touch any of the lattice lines is $\frac{a^2}{b^2}$, where $\frac{a}{b}$ is a reduced fraction, find $a + b$.",NA,6029
"Graph $G_1$ of a quadratic trinomial $y = px^2 + qx + r$ with real coefficients intersects the graph $G_2$ of a quadratic trinomial $y = x^2$ at points $A$ and $B$. The intersection of tangents to $G_2$ at points $A$ and $B$ is point $C$. If $C$ lies on $G_1$, find all possible values of $p$.",NA,2
"Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle. Construct points $A'$, $B'$, $C'$ on its sides $BC$, $CA$, $AB$ such that:
- $A'B' \parallel AB$, 
- $C'C$ is the bisector of angle $A'C'B'$, 
- $A'C' + B'C' = AB$.",NA,1
"The radius $r$ of a circle with center at the origin is an odd integer. There is a point $(p^m, q^n)$ on the circle, with $p, q$ being prime numbers and $m, n$ being positive integers. Determine $r$.",2,5
"Using each of the digits $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 8, 9$ exactly once, we form nine, not necessarily distinct, nine-digit numbers. Their sum ends in $n$ zeroes, where $n$ is a non-negative integer. Determine the maximum possible value of $n$.",NA,8
"Determine the largest positive integer $n$ such that the following statement holds:

If $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6$ are six distinct positive integers less than or equal to $n$, then there exist three distinct positive integers from these six, say $a$, $b$, and $c$, such that $ab > c$, $bc > a$, and $ca > b$.",20,107
"Solve for $x$:
\[
v - w + x - y + z = 79 \\
v + w + x + y + z = -1 \\
v + 2w + 4x + 8y + 16z = -2 \\
v + 3w + 9x + 27y + 81z = -1 \\
v + 5w + 25x + 125y + 625z = 79.

"You have a 4-digit whole number that is a perfect square. Another number is constructed by making the following changes to the digits of the original number:

1. Add 1 to the unit's digit.
2. Subtract 1 from the ten's digit.
3. Add 1 to the hundred's digit.
4. Subtract 1 from the thousand's digit.

If the resulting number is also a perfect square, find the original number. Is it unique?",NA,3025
