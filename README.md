# SPARK: Student Performance Advancement through Refined Knowledge

## Overview

**SPARK** is a novel research initiative designed to overcome the limitations of traditional Knowledge Distillation (KD) in Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs are becoming increasingly capable, their training and fine-tuning require immense computational power—posing sustainability concerns due to carbon emissions.

SPARK proposes a transformative shift from passive teacher-student learning to an **interactive, intervention-driven paradigm** that actively targets weaknesses, decomposes complex tasks, and adapts to evolving learning needs. Our goal: to create **smaller, smarter, and more sustainable models** that generalize better across tasks and domains.

##  Key Contributions

-  **Conceptual Adversarial Scaffolding (CASAM)**: Targets reasoning gaps in mathematical problems.
-  **Cross-Domain Adaptation**: Enables multilingual and legal task transfers via cultural and procedural decomposition.
-  **Persona-Adaptive Dialogue**: Trains students to respond appropriately across varying user personas.
-  **Negative Example Synthesis**: Builds robustness via plausible-but-incorrect adversarial data.
-  **Creativeness Evaluation**: Evaluates and teaches creativity under structured constraints (e.g., rhyme, meter).

## Problem Statement

> How can interactive, process-oriented teaching methods surpass output mimicry to optimize cross-domain generalization and computational efficiency?

Traditional KD enforces output mimicry that leads to:
- Static supervision
- Task brittleness
- Evaluation myopia

**SPARK** addresses these through proactive, context-aware, and feedback-driven interventions.

## Proposed Frameworks

### 1. **CASAM: Mathematical Reasoning Enhancement**
- Dataset: MATH, LeanDojo
- Omitted proof steps force logical reasoning
- Enhances transfer from algebra to geometry

### 2. **Cross-Domain Adaptation**
- Datasets: NLLB, CulturaX, LEXGLUE
- Cultural and legal decompositions to teach nuanced contextual knowledge
- Procedural complexity tailored to domain specificity

### 3. **Persona-Adaptive Dialogue Training**
- Dataset: Persona-Chat
- Trains students on style-specific conversations (formal, colloquial, technical)
- Style-retention ≥90% targeted

### 4. **Negative Example Synthesis**
- Dataset: MATH/Confident-Wrong
- Simulated errors (e.g., algebraic sign flips) to boost student discrimination power

### 5. **Creativeness Evaluation**
- Dataset: Poetry Foundation
- Combines rule-compliance (rhyme/meter) with novelty scoring
- Promotes creativity-efficient generation in small models

## Gap Analysis

### 2.2.1 Limitations in Existing Methods

| Method | Limitation |
|--------|-----------|
| Knowledge Distillation | Static transfer, poor generalization, teacher-bias replication |
| Retrieval-Augmented Generation | Quality dependent, integration issues |
| Reinforcement Learning | High cost, instability |
| Fine-Tuning | Overfits on small data, expensive |
| Multi-Agent | Coordination complexity |
| Pseudo-Labeling | Label noise |
| Hierarchical Gen. | Diversity and scalability limitations |

### 2.2.2 Research Gaps

- Overemphasis on static knowledge transfer
- Ignored student feedback and evolving learning states
- Evaluation focused on accuracy, not adaptability or robustness
- Environmental cost rarely addressed

## Methodology & Evaluation

SPARK evaluates interventions across:

-  **Reasoning Robustness**
-  **Adaptability to Learning Progress**
-  **Cross-Domain Generalization**
-  **Computational Efficiency**
-  **Style/Persona Consistency**

---

## Sustainability Focus

By reducing dependency on large teacher models and promoting **active learning**, SPARK contributes to:

- Lower carbon footprint in LLM training
- Energy-efficient deployment (edge/fog computing ready)
- Ethical and scalable knowledge transfer

---

## Future Plans

1. **LeanDojo Integration** for formal proof verification in CASAM  
2. **Cross-Legal/Multilingual Task Decomposition** in LEXGLUE & CulturaX  
3. **Open-Source Toolkit** for intervention-based student model training  
4. **Standardized Benchmarks** to evaluate feedback-driven teaching efficacy  
5. **Publication Goals**: ACL SRW, AACL, EMNLP (A/A* tier)
